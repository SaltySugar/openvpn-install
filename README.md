## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

### In case your openvpn server failed to start with error: "daemon() failed or unsupported: Resource temporarily unavailable (errno=11)"

Set LimitNPROC=infinity in /lib/systemd/system/openvpn@.service.

And run systemctl daemon-reload after that.
